## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for completely refreshing the Concrete Mix Database (CDB) to address systemic data import issues. The plan aims to create a clean, consistent database while minimizing disruption and mitigating potential risks.

**Target Completion Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Project Lead:** Database Team  
**Current Status:** DS1 and DS2 successfully imported (1,764 total mixes). DS3-DS6 pending.

## Background and Justification

Data validation has revealed significant inconsistencies in the database, particularly with the DS2 dataset (dataset_id=9), including:

- Mix code misalignment (database mix codes don't match source data)
- Missing components (especially aggregates)
- Incorrect water-binder ratios
- Incomplete material properties

These issues affect data integrity and the reliability of analysis based on the current database. Starting fresh with improved import validation is the most efficient solution.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Backup (COMPLETED)

#### Data Backup and Export

1. **Complete Database Dump**
   - Create a full SQL dump of the existing database
   - Store multiple copies in secure locations
   
2. **Table-Level CSV Exports**
   - Export all tables to CSV format for easy reference
   - Include lookup tables, mix components, and user-created content
   
3. **User Content Identification**
   - Identify and isolate any user-created or manually adjusted data
   - Create special exports of this data for potential re-import

4. **ID Reference Mapping**
   - Create a mapping of current mix IDs to original dataset identifiers
   - Document this mapping for reference during and after transition

#### Environment Setup

1. **Create a Staging Environment**
   - Set up a replica of the production environment
   - Validate that the staging environment functions correctly

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Data Loss Prevention

- **Multiple Backups**: Maintain at least three copies of all data
- **Staggered Backup Timing**: Create backups at different stages of the process
- **Verification**: Test backup restoration before proceeding with data deletion

### Minimizing Disruption

- **Off-Hours Implementation**: Schedule the most disruptive work outside of business hours
- **Phased Approach**: Implement changes in logical segments with verification at each step
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain the ability to revert to the original database if critical issues arise

### Maintaining Reference Integrity

- **ID Mapping Document**: Create and maintain a reference document mapping old IDs to new ones
- **Legacy ID Field**: Consider adding a field to store original IDs for cross-reference
- **URL Redirection**: For critical paths, implement redirects from old IDs to new ones

### Quality Assurance

- **Validation Framework**: Utilize the comprehensive validation checklists defined in the Appendix section
- **Manual Spot Checks**: Perform targeted verification of key concrete mixes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Verify system performance meets or exceeds pre-refresh benchmarks

## Rollback Plan

**Current Status**: DS1 and DS2 successfully imported with 100% validation success. Rollback procedures maintained for DS3-DS6 imports and future operations.

### For Remaining Dataset Imports (DS3-DS6)

In case of significant issues during future dataset imports that cannot be resolved:

1. **Decision Point Identification**
   - Pre-define criteria for rollback decisions for each dataset import
   - Maintain ability to rollback to last successful state (currently DS1+DS2)
   - Authority for rollback decision remains with primary developer/product owner

2. **Rollback Procedure**
   - **Granular Rollback**: Remove only the problematic dataset while preserving DS1+DS2
   - **Database State Restoration**: Restore to pre-import state using automated backup system
   - **Sequence Reset**: Reset database sequences to continue from last successful import
   - **Code Reversion**: Revert any configuration or code changes specific to the failed import

3. **Validation and Recovery**
   - Verify database integrity after rollback using automated validation framework
   - Confirm DS1+DS2 data remains intact and functional
   - Document lessons learned for future import attempts
   - Prepare revised approach for re-attempting the failed dataset

### For Future Multi-User Operations

When operating with hundreds of users:

1. **Enhanced Communication**
   - Immediate notification to all users via implemented notification system
   - Clear timeline for issue resolution and re-attempt
   - Status page updates showing current system state

2. **Minimized User Impact**
   - Rollback to last stable state to restore user access quickly
   - Preserve all user-generated content and preferences
   - Maintain system availability during rollback operations

## Communication Plan

### Current Development Environment (Single User)

- **Development Progress Tracking**: Maintain CHANGELOG.md and MASTER_CHANGELOG.md for comprehensive progress documentation
- **Technical Documentation**: Update LESSONS_LEARNED.md with methodologies and discoveries
- **Status Monitoring**: Use implemented status page and logging systems for development tracking

### Future Multi-User Deployment

#### Pre-Implementation Communication
- Announce the planned refresh with at least one week's notice using the implemented notification system
- Provide detailed timeline and expected impacts through notification management interface
- Give users guidance on any preparations they should make
- Use email notification functionality to reach all active users

#### During Implementation
- Maintain status page with regular updates showing import progress
- Provide clear indicators of progress through notification banners
- Communicate any delays or issues promptly via the notification system

#### Post-Implementation
- Announce completion and system availability through notification system
- Provide documentation on any changes to workflows
- Establish feedback mechanism for reporting issues

**Note**: All multi-user communication infrastructure is implemented and tested, ready for deployment when user base expands.
