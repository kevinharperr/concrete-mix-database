# DS6 Dataset Changelog

## Date: May 7, 2025

## Overview
This file documents the actions taken related to the DS6 dataset in the concrete mix project, including errors encountered and their resolutions.

## Initial State
- The original DS6 dataset contains 654 concrete mixes
- Initial import attempts were unsuccessful in properly linking material properties

## Actions Taken

### 1. DS6 Properties Import Issues
- Initial import resulted in 0 unique materials and properties linked to DS6 mixes
- Material properties import created new 'DS6_PROPS-XX' mixes instead of linking to existing 'DS6-XX' mixes
- Mix codes were not successfully renamed from 'DS6_PROPS-' to 'DS6-' during the import process

### 2. Attempted Fixes (unsuccessful)
- Created a series of diagnostic scripts to analyze the state of DS6 data in the database
- Discovered that the material properties were not being correctly linked to existing materials
- Created a `link_material_properties.py` script to try to link properties to materials used in mixes
- The approach was flawed - tried to link a small number of properties (12) when the original dataset contained 654 mixes

### 3. Critical Errors
- **Misconception**: Worked with only a subset of the data (erroneously referenced 134 mixes instead of 654)
- **Implementation Error**: Created multiple overlapping scripts instead of a cohesive solution
- **Database Error**: Created properties linked to materials not used in mixes, necessitating a complete purge

### 4. Database Purge
- Created `thorough_ds6_purge.py` to completely clean up all DS6-related data
- Successfully purged from database:
  - 5,232 DS6 mixes
  - 27,048 mix components related to these mixes
  - 2 DS6 datasets (DS6 and DS6_PROPS)

### 5. Cleanup
- Removed temporary scripts:
  - check_mix_codes.py
  - find_all_mixes.py
  - check_database.py
  - fix_ds6_final.py
  - link_material_properties.py
  - validate_property_linking.py
  - purge_ds6_data.py
- Kept thorough_ds6_purge.py for reference

## Current State
- All DS6-related data has been completely purged from the database
- Successfully reimported DS6 dataset using the new material reference system
- All 654 mixes properly imported with correctly linked material properties and aggregate details
- 2,114 performance results successfully imported with proper age and specimen data

## Material Reference System Implementation (May 7, 2025)

### Issues Addressed
- Could not properly link material properties and aggregate details to materials during import
- Warnings about missing material_id for properties and aggregate details during import
- Performance results not being captured due to incorrect column mappings

### Solution Implemented
1. **Material Reference System**:
   - Implemented a system in `import_ds.py` to track materials by reference keys
   - Materials are now tracked in a dictionary called `material_refs` during import
   - Reference keys allow for linking properties without requiring direct material IDs

2. **Column Mapping Improvements**:
   - Created tools to ensure proper JSON formatting in mapping files
   - Created `create_corrected_mapping.py` to generate properly formatted mapping files
   - Updated mapping with correct performance result column names

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Developed `ds6_health_check.py` to evaluate dataset integrity with detailed counts
   - Created `generate_ds6_health_flags.py` to assess data quality and completeness
   - Generated health flags CSV with metrics for each mix

### Import Results
- Successfully imported all 654 DS6 mixes with proper material references
- Imported 2,114 performance results (compressive strength tests)
- 95.1% of mixes (622 out of 654) have 28-day strength data
- 4.9% of mixes (32 out of 654) are missing 28-day strength data
- 100% of mixes are missing slump data (not included in original dataset)
- No warnings about missing material IDs during import process

## Future Plans
- Create comprehensive mapping files for all columns in the DS6 dataset
- Apply the reference key system to all future dataset imports to maintain consistent relationships
- Develop templates and validation tools for mapping file creation to ensure consistency

## Next Steps
- Review the original DS6 dataset containing 654 mixes
- Create proper column mapping files for main dataset and properties
- Implement a correct import process that properly links materials and properties
- Verify data integrity after import with health checks

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify the scope of the dataset before beginning work
2. Database operations should be carefully planned and tested on small samples
3. Create a comprehensive data model diagram to understand relationships
4. Implement feature flags for new functionality to allow easy rollback
5. Ensure mapper files correctly specify linking parameters for material properties

## 2025-05-06 22:58:35 - DS6 Mix Code Standardization

* Changed mix code: 35 -> DS6-35
* Changed mix code: 35 -> DS6-35-R
* Changed mix code: 36 -> DS6-36
* Changed mix code: 36 -> DS6-36-R
* Changed mix code: 2 -> DS6-2
* Changed mix code: 2 -> DS6-2-R
* Changed mix code: 3 -> DS6-3
* Changed mix code: 3 -> DS6-3-R
* ... and 88 more changes
