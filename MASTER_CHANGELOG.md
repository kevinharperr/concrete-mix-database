## DS2 Sequence Reset and Re-import Success (28.05.2025, 17:05)

### Problem Identified and Resolved

- **ID Sequence Gap Issue**: DS1 ended at mix_id 1030, but DS2 started at mix_id 3967, creating a gap of 2,936 IDs due to multiple import/delete cycles during development
- **PostgreSQL Sequence Misalignment**: Database sequences were out of sync with actual data, causing non-sequential ID assignment
- **Data Integrity Concerns**: Large ID gaps made data relationships harder to trace and wasted primary key space

### Technical Resolution

- **Sequence Discovery**: Identified actual PostgreSQL sequence names (e.g., `concrete_mix_mix_id_seq`) vs Django's expected names (`cdb_app_concretemix_mix_id_seq`)
- **Systematic Reset Process**: 
  1. Captured DS1 maximum IDs: mix_id=1030, component_id=5799, result_id=1030, specimen_id=0
  2. Completely purged DS2 data (734 mixes and 4,746 related records)
  3. Reset sequences to continue from DS1 endpoints using `setval()` commands
  4. Re-imported DS2 with corrected sequential assignment

### Perfect Results Achieved

- **âœ… Perfect Sequential Order**: DS1 (1-1030) â†’ DS2 (1031-1764) with **zero gaps**
- **âœ… Complete Data Import**: 734/734 DS2 mixes imported successfully (100% success rate)
- **âœ… Full Component Coverage**: 2,544 components created with proper cementitious classification
- **âœ… All Performance Results**: 734 performance results imported (100% success rate)
- **âœ… Sequence Alignment**: All PostgreSQL sequences correctly positioned for DS3-DS6 imports

### Database Final State

## ETL Framework Implementation for Database Refresh (May 16, 2025, 16:03)

### Issues Identified
- **Data Inconsistency**: Previous data imports lacked rigorous validation, resulting in physically impossible water-binder ratios
- **Missing Components**: Many mixes were imported without essential components (cement, water, or aggregate)
- **Import Process Fragmentation**: ETL processes varied by dataset, leading to inconsistent data quality
- **Validation Gap**: No systematic pre-import validation to catch problematic data before database insertion

### Actions Taken
1. **ETL Framework Development**:
   - Created `BaseImporter` class with comprehensive validation logic for concrete mixes
   - Implemented `StandardDatasetImporter` for consistent handling of CSV datasets
   - Developed `DatasetValidator` tool for pre-import validation and reporting
2. **Validation Rules Implementation**:
   - Water-binder ratio checks (valid range: 0.25-0.70)
   - Minimum component requirements (cement, water, aggregate)
   - Cement content validation (100-600 kg/mÂ³)
   - Water content validation (100-300 kg/mÂ³)
3. **Process Documentation**:
   - Updated `DATABASE_REFRESH_PLAN.md` to reflect implementation progress
   - Documented validation approach in code comments and README

### Results
- Created unified framework for all future dataset imports with consistent validation
- Implemented data quality scoring system for imported mixes
- Enhanced error handling and logging for traceable import processes
- Completed Phase 2 of the Database Refresh Plan (ETL Script Redesign, Component Validation, Testing Framework)

## Water-Binder Ratio Calculation Update (May 14, 2025, 16:09)

### Issues Identified
- **Inconsistent W/B Ratios**: Several mixes had abnormally high water-binder ratios (>1.0)
- **SCM Recognition**: Certain SCM types like 'CFA' and 'FA-B' were not being properly recognized as reactive SCMs
- **Type Mismatches**: Decimal vs float comparison issues causing calculation errors
- **Calculation Logic**: Original calculation was complex and didn't align with simplified W/B approach

### Actions Taken
1. **Revised W/B Calculation Logic**: 
   - Implemented simple Water/(Cement+SCMs) ratio for improved consistency
   - Updated `update_wb_ratio.py` management command with revised calculation method
2. **Enhanced Cementitious Material Identification**:
   - Improved verification of the `is_cementitious` flag for all materials
   - Added special handling for SCM subtypes ('FA-B', 'CFA', 'SF', 'GGBS')
3. **Type Handling**: Fixed Decimal vs float comparison issues for reliable calculations
4. **Diagnostic Tool**: Created `check_wb_ratios.py` diagnostic script for detailed analysis of mix compositions

### Results
- Successfully standardized W/B ratios across the database
- Reduced number of mixes with W/B ratio > 0.8 to only 14 (all valid by design)
- All problematic mixes now have physically reasonable W/B values
- Created documentation for W/B ratio calculation methodology

## Database Integrity Fix (May 6, 2025, 20:35)

### Issues Identified
- **Non-standard Mix Codes**: 1,500 mixes (27% of database) had non-standard naming without the DS#-## format
- **ID Sequencing**: Mix IDs ranged from 6 to 13840 with large gaps, indicating deleted records
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Particularly in DS4 dataset where mix codes were simple numbers ("1", "2", "3") instead of "DS4-1", etc.
- **Potential Duplicates**: Some mix codes appeared in multiple datasets without proper distinguishing prefixes

### Actions Taken
1. **Full Database Backup**: Created CSV backup at `db_backup/mix_backup_20250506_203544.csv`
2. **Mix Code Standardization**: 
   - Converted all 1,500 non-standard mix codes to DS#-## format
   - Examples: "1" â†’ "DS4-1", "27" â†’ "DS5-27", "1350" â†’ "DS5-1350"
3. **Verification**: Confirmed all mix codes now follow the standard pattern
4. **ID Preservation**: Maintained existing ID sequences to preserve relationships

### Results
- Successfully standardized 1,500 mix codes
- Non-standard codes remaining: 0
- Duplicate codes remaining: 0
- All database relationships preserved
