## ETL Framework Implementation for Database Refresh (May 16, 2025, 16:03)

### Issues Identified
- **Data Inconsistency**: Previous data imports lacked rigorous validation, resulting in physically impossible water-binder ratios
- **Missing Components**: Many mixes were imported without essential components (cement, water, or aggregate)
- **Import Process Fragmentation**: ETL processes varied by dataset, leading to inconsistent data quality
- **Validation Gap**: No systematic pre-import validation to catch problematic data before database insertion

### Actions Taken
1. **ETL Framework Development**:
   - Created `BaseImporter` class with comprehensive validation logic for concrete mixes
   - Implemented `StandardDatasetImporter` for consistent handling of CSV datasets
   - Developed `DatasetValidator` tool for pre-import validation and reporting

   - Water-binder ratio checks (valid range: 0.25-0.70)
   - Minimum component requirements (cement, water, aggregate)
   - Cement content validation (100-600 kg/m³)
   - Water content validation (100-300 kg/m³)
3. **Process Documentation**:
   - Updated `DATABASE_REFRESH_PLAN.md` to reflect implementation progress
   - Documented validation approach in code comments and README

### Results

- **Inconsistent W/B Ratios**: Several mixes had abnormally high water-binder ratios (>1.0)
- **SCM Recognition**: Certain SCM types like 'CFA' and 'FA-B' were not being properly recognized as reactive SCMs
- **Type Mismatches**: Decimal vs float comparison issues causing calculation errors
- **Calculation Logic**: Original calculation was complex and didn't align with simplified W/B approach

### Actions Taken
1. **Revised W/B Calculation Logic**: 
   - Implemented simple Water/(Cement+SCMs) ratio for improved consistency
   - Updated `update_wb_ratio.py` management command with revised calculation method

3. **Type Handling**: Fixed Decimal vs float comparison issues for reliable calculations
4. **Diagnostic Tool**: Created `check_wb_ratios.py` diagnostic script for detailed analysis of mix compositions

### Results
- Successfully standardized W/B ratios across the database
- Reduced number of mixes with W/B ratio > 0.8 to only 14 (all valid by design)
- All problematic mixes now have physically reasonable W/B values
- Created documentation for W/B ratio calculation methodology

## Database Integrity Fix (May 6, 2025, 20:35)

### Issues Identified
- **Non-standard Mix Codes**: 1,500 mixes (27% of database) had non-standard naming without the DS#-## format
- **ID Sequencing**: Mix IDs ranged from 6 to 13840 with large gaps, indicating deleted records
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Particularly in DS4 dataset where mix codes were simple numbers ("1", "2", "3") instead of "DS4-1", etc.
- **Potential Duplicates**: Some mix codes appeared in multiple datasets without proper distinguishing prefixes

### Actions Taken
1. **Full Database Backup**: Created CSV backup at `db_backup/mix_backup_20250506_203544.csv`
2. **Mix Code Standardization**: 
   - Converted all 1,500 non-standard mix codes to DS#-## format
   - Examples: "1" → "DS4-1", "27" → "DS5-27", "1350" → "DS5-1350"
3. **Verification**: Confirmed all mix codes now follow the standard pattern
4. **ID Preservation**: Maintained existing ID sequences to preserve relationships

### Results
- Successfully standardized 1,500 mix codes
- Non-standard codes remaining: 0
- Duplicate codes remaining: 0

- Actual mix numbers were embedded in the notes as "Dataset: DS6; Mix number: X"

### Actions Taken
1. Created `fix_ds6_mixcodes.sql` to:
   - Move the mix number from the notes to the `mix_code` field in proper "DS6-X" format
   - Move the study number from `mix_code` to the notes as "Study reference: X"

## DS6 Water-Binder Ratio Fix (May 7, 2025, 17:13)

### Issues Identified
- DS6 dataset's water-to-binder ratios were incorrectly stored in the `w_c_ratio` column
- The `w_b_ratio` column was empty for all DS6 mixes
- Original ds6.csv only had `wbr_total` (water-to-binder ratio) values, no water-to-cement ratios

### Actions Taken
1. Created and applied `fix_ds6_ratios.sql` to:
   - Move all values from `w_c_ratio` to the correct `w_b_ratio` column
   - Set `w_c_ratio` to NULL for all DS6 mixes
   - Create audit records to track changes

### Results
- Successfully moved water-binder ratios for all 654 DS6 mixes
