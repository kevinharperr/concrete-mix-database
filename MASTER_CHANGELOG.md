# Concrete Mix Database - Master Changelog

## Last Updated: 02.06.2025, 18:00

## ðŸš€ **DS3 DATASET IMPORT - COMPLETE SUCCESS** (02.06.2025, 18:00)

### **Perfect Import Achievement: 2,312/2,312 mixes (100% success rate)**

#### **Dataset Overview**
- **Source**: DS3 - Multinational concrete with recycled aggregates and SCMs (Phoeuk & Kwon, 2023)
- **Scope**: International research dataset with 25 countries represented
- **Complexity**: Mixed data types, trailing spaces in column headers, missing values, international naming variations

#### **ðŸ”§ Major Technical Challenges Overcome**

**1. Water Component Creation Crisis**
- **Issue**: W/C ratios showing as None despite successful import claiming success
- **Root Cause**: CSV column header 'eff_water (kg/m3)  ' contained trailing spaces
- **Hardcoded Problem**: water_columns list in importer engine didn't include exact column name
- **Solution**: Added exact column name with trailing spaces to water_columns list
- **Impact**: W/C ratios instantly corrected from None to proper calculated values

**2. Mix Code Display Failure**
- **Issue**: Mix codes displaying as "None" instead of "DS3-1", "DS3-2", etc.
- **Data Investigation**: mix_mark column had 958 NaN values out of 2,312 total rows
- **Discovery**: mix_number column contained complete sequential data 1-2312
- **Solution**: Updated DS3 config column mapping from mix_mark to mix_number
- **Result**: Perfect mix code generation DS3-1 through DS3-2312

**3. Decimal Precision Excess**
- **Issue**: W/C and W/B ratios displaying with 28+ decimal places (0.6428571428571428571428571429)
- **Root Cause**: Python Decimal division creating excessive precision
- **Solution**: Added round(value, 2) to both calculated and pre-calculated ratio handling
- **Applied To**: Both DS3 calculated ratios and DS2 pre-calculated ratios
- **Result**: Clean professional decimal precision (0.64, 0.58, 0.45)

**4. Region/Country Data Empty Fields**
- **Issue**: All region_country fields showing as 'None' despite CSV having 25 different countries
- **Root Cause**: _safe_decimal() function tried to convert country names to Decimal, failing and returning None
- **Discovery**: Direct field mapping logic needed mixed data type handling
- **Solution**: Modified importer engine to try decimal conversion first, fallback to string handling
- **Result**: All 25 countries perfectly imported (Spain, Mexico, United States, Colombia, Greece, Portugal, etc.)

master_test_method, created = TestMethod.objects.get_or_create(
    description='Compressive Strength Test',
    defaults={'clause': 'Various standards'}
)

# Migrate all compressive strength results
for old_method in old_test_methods:
    PerformanceResult.objects.filter(test_method=old_method).update(
        test_method=master_test_method
    )
    old_method.delete()
```

- **Systematic Reset Process**: 
  1. Captured DS1 maximum IDs: mix_id=1030, component_id=5799, result_id=1030, specimen_id=0
  2. Completely purged DS2 data (734 mixes and 4,746 related records)
  3. Reset sequences to continue from DS1 endpoints using `setval()` commands
  4. Re-imported DS2 with corrected sequential assignment

### Perfect Results Achieved

- **âœ… Perfect Sequential Order**: DS1 (1-1030) â†’ DS2 (1031-1764) with **zero gaps**
